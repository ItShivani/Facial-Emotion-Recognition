# Facial Emotion Recognition Project README

## Overview
This project utilizes advanced CNN architectures including a standard CNN, Optimized CNN, VGG, ResNet, MobileNetV2, and SENet for real-time facial emotion recognition.
This deep learning project employs various CNN architectures to recognize facial emotions in real-time using live webcam feed.

## Models
- **CNN**: Baseline Convolutional Neural Network model.
- **Optimized CNN**: Enhanced CNN with improved architecture for better performance.
- **VGG**: Deep learning model known for its effectiveness in image recognition.
- **ResNet**: Utilizes residual learning for training deeper networks.
- **MobileNetV2**: Efficient model for mobile and edge devices.
- **SENet**: Incorporates channel relationships for improved representational power.
